##About This Repository

This repository contains three folders: Labs, Practice Assignment, and Practice Final. All SystemVerilog (with extension .sv) code in this repository are written by me. Any Verilog code (with extension .v) may contain a combination of work by me or by others. Appropriate remarks are made as to which part of the code are written and modified by me.

All code has been tested and they are all synthesizable. They are synthesized in Quartus II 14.1 for the [DE1-SoC FPGA Board](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=167&No=836).
